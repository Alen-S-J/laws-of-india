But if the Veterinary Practitioner is of opinion that the animal can be removed from the place where it is found without causing it great suffering and if the owner or person in charge of the animal or in his absence any other person present on the spot, is willing or offers to remove the animal to the nearest veterinary hospital in such time as the veterinary practitioner considers reasonable, the Veterinary Practitioner shall allow the animal to be so removed. If the owner or person in charge of the animal or any other person does not consent or fails so to remove the animal, the Veterinary Practitioner may direct the Police Officer to remove the animal before it is destroyed to such place as he may think it.</p>
            <p>Provided that when any animal is destroyed in any street or public place it shall, as far as possible, be screened from the public gaze while it is being destroyed.</p>
