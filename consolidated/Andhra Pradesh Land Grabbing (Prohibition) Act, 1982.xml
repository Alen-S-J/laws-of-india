      <longTitle>
        <p>Act No. 12 of 1982</p>
        <p>An Act to prohibit the activity of land grabbing in the State of Andhra Pradesh and to provide for matters connected therewith.</p>
        <p>Whereas there are organised attempts on the part of certain lawless persons operating individually and in groups, to grab, either by force or by deceit or otherwise, lands (whether belonging to the Government, a local authority, a religious or charitable institution or endowment, including a wakf, or any other private persons) who are known as "land grabbers".</p>
        <p>And whereas such land grabbers are forming bogus co-operative housing societies or setting up fictitious claims and indulging in large scale and unprecedented and fraudulent sales of lands belonging to the Government, local authority, religious or charitable institutions or endowments including a wakf or private persons, through unscrupulous real estate dealers or otherwise in favour of certain sections of the people resulting in large accumulation of unaccounted wealth and quick money to land grabbersÍ¾</p>
        <p>And whereas, having regard to the resources and influence of the persons by whom, the large scale on which and the manner in which, the unlawful activity of land grabbing was, has been or is being organised and carried on in violation of law by them, as land grabbers in the State of Andhra Pradesh, and particularly in its urban areas, it is necessary to arrest and curb immediately such unlawful activity of land grabbing;</p>
        <p>And whereas public order is adversely affected by such unlawful activity of land grabbers.</p>
        <p>Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Andhra Pradesh in the Thirty-third year of the Republic of India as follows :</p>
