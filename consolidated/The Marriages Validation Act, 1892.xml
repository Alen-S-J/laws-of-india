      <p>An Act to validate certain marriages solemnized under Part VI of the Indian Christian Marriages Act, 1872.</p>
      <p>WHEREAS provision is made in Part VI of the Indian Christian Marriage Act (15 of 1872) for the solemnization of marriages between persons of whom both are Indian Christians, but not of marriages between persons of whom one only is an Indian Christian;</p>
      <p>AND WHEREAS persons licensed under section 9 of the said Act have in diverse part of India, through ignorance of the law, permitted marriages to be solemnized in their presence under the said Part between persons of whom one is an Indian Christian and the other is not an Indian Christian;</p>
      <p>AND WHEREAS it is expedient that such marriages, having been solemnized in good faith, should be validated ;</p>
      <p>It is thereby enacted as follows:-</p>
