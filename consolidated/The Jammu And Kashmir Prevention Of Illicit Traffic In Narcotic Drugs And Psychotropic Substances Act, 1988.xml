    <preamble>
      <p>An Act to provide for detention in certain cases for the purposes of preventing illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and combating abuse of such drugs and substances and for matters connected therewith.</p>
      <p>Whereas illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances poses a serious threat to the health and welfare of the people and activities of persons engaged in such illicit traffic have deleterious effect on the national economy;</p>
      <p>And whereas having regard to the persons by whom and the manner in which such illicit traffic is organised and carried on, and having regard to the fact that in certain areas which are highly vulnerable to such illicit traffic, such activities of a considerable magnitude are clandestinely organised and carried on, it is necessary for the effective prevention of such activities to provide for detection of persons concerned in any manner therewith.</p>
      <p>Be it enacted by the Jammu and Kashmir State Legislature in the Thirty-ninth Year of the Republic of India as follows:-</p>
