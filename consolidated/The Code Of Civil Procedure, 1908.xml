              <p>Explanation.-The pendency of a suit in a foreign Court does not preclude the Courts in India from trying a suit founded on the same cause of action.</p>

              <p>Explanation I.--The expression "former suit" shall denote a suit which has been decided prior to the suit in question whether or not it was instituted prior thereto.</p>
              <p>Explanation II.--For the purposes of this section, the competence of a Court shall be determined irrespective of any provisions as to a right of appeal from the decision of such Court.</p>

              <p>Where and in so far as a decree is for the payment of money, the Court may, in the decree, order interest at such rate as the Court deems reasonable to be paid on the principal sum adjudged, from the date of the suit to the date of the decree, in addition to any interest adjudged on such principal sum for any period prior to the institution of the suit,with further interest at such rate not exceeding six per cent per annum as the Court deems reasonable on such principal sum, from the date of the decree to the date of payment, or to such earlier date as the Court thinks fit:</p>
              <p>Provided that where the liability in relation to the sum so adjudged had arisen out of a commercial transaction, the rate of such further interest may exceed six per cent, per annum, but shall not exceed the contractual rate of interest or where there is no contractual rate, the rate at which moneys are lent or advanced by nationalised banks in relation to commercial transactions.</p>
              <p>Explanation I.--In this sub-section, "nationalised bank" me ans a corresponding new bank as defined in the Banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Act, 1970 ( 5 of 1970 ).</p>
              <p>Explanation II.--For the purposes of this section, a transaction is a commercial transaction, if it is connected with the industry, trade or business of the party incurring the liability.</p>

                  <p>Provided that, where the decree, or such interest as aforesaid, has been transferred by assignment, notice of such application shall be given to the transferor and the judgment-debtor, and the decree shall not be executed until the Court has heard their objections (if any) to its execution:</p>

                  <p>Illustration:</p>
                  <p>A, a person of little substance, erects a building which renders uninhabitable a family mansion belonging to B. A, in spite of his detention in prison and the attachment of his property, declines to obey a decree obtained against him by B and directing him to remove the building. The Court is of opinion that no sum realizable by the sale of A’s property would adequately compensate B for the depreciation in the value of his mansion. B may apply to the Court to remove the building and may recover the cost of such removal from A in the execution-proceedings.</p>
