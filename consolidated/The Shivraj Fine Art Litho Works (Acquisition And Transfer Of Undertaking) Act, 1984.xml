        <p>AND WHEREAS in Writ Petition No. 2741 of 1980 filed by some of the partners challenging the order of the Government of India taking over the management of the undertaking as aforesaid, the High Court of Bombay, Nagpur Bench, quashed the said order by its judgement rendered on the 28th April 1982;</p>
